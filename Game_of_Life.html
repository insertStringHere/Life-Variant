	<!--Manual:
		Conway's game of life functions according to four rules:
			1.) If a cell has less than 2 neighboring cells, it will die by underpopulation
			2.) If a cell has more than 3 neighboring cells, it will die by overpopulation.
			3.) If a cell has 2 or 3 neighboring cells, it will survive into the next generation
			4.) If an empty cell is surrounded by exactly 3 cells, a new cell will be born.
		In this simulation, every box counts as a cell. By clicking these cells, it will toggle whether or not that cell is alive.
		Pressing "Start" will begin the simulation using the listed rules at the speed selected in the dropdown.
		Pressing "Step" will proceed the simulation by exactly one generation.
		When the simulation is running, the "Start" button will be come "Stop". Press this button to pause the simulation.

				Reflection:
					I tested my project by running another Game of Life simulation side by side with my own.
					The two worked almost exactly the same, with the exception of how the edges function. On my design,
					I chose to have anything beyond the grid count as permanent dead spaces, and as such the way that 
					my edges work is different than the simulation I was using, which allows the simulation to continue
					beyond the edges and for moving cells to extend beyond them.
