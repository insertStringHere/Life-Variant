	<!--Manual:
		Conway's game of life functions according to four rules:
			1.) If a cell has less than 2 neighboring cells, it will die by underpopulation
			2.) If a cell has more than 3 neighboring cells, it will die by overpopulation.
			3.) If a cell has 2 or 3 neighboring cells, it will survive into the next generation
			4.) If an empty cell is surrounded by exactly 3 cells, a new cell will be born.
		In this simulation, every box counts as a cell. By clicking these cells, it will toggle whether or not that cell is alive.
		Pressing "Start" will begin the simulation using the listed rules at the speed selected in the dropdown.
		Pressing "Step" will proceed the simulation by exactly one generation.
		When the simulation is running, the "Start" button will be come "Stop". Press this button to pause the simulation.
